## The Challenge

You have the entire  month of November to create a game  *loosely* based on the
theme **hacking, modding and/or augmenting**.

What do we mean by **loosely**  based on hacking, modding and/or augmenting? We
literally mean, *loosely* based. Some examples might be:

* an endless  runner where  you *hack* down  binary trees in  your path  with a
* apixelated axe, *modern* take on a classic e.g. a roguelike set in a 3D or VR
* aworld, or n  *augmented* reality game bringing octopus/cat  hybrids into the
  areal world.

Unleash your creativity.  You can work alone  or with a team and  build for any
platform  or device.  The use  of  open source  game engines  and libraries  is
encouraged but not required.

We'll highlight some  of our favorites on  the GitHub blog, and  the world will
get to enjoy (and maybe even contribute to and/or learn from) your creations.

## The Game

[GitHub + NetHack = zero-player RPG][githack]

NetHack.  Good  old  classic.  Want  to touch  the  legendary  game,  but  fear
to  lost  in  it?  Fear  not!  With  this  service,  you  may  simply  continue
hacking  on GitHub,  while our  specially created  [Tactical Amulet  Extraction
Bot][bothack]<sup>tm</sup> (thanks, @krajj7!) will do the rest.

Each your action on GitHub - it is one more turn within NetHack. Just open your
page from time to time: maybe, you've already taken Amulet of Yendor?

## The Development

Well, it is my first project written  in Clojure. In other words, I was hacking
Clojure while hacking GitHack! I've noticed that the challenge began too late -
in the  middle of November,  but I decided  to implement this  zero-player game
anyway, since I started  to think about it a long time ago.  And you know what?
Despite the fact that a lot of stuff  need to be implemented, I am pretty happy
with it!
